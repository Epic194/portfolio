  <h2> Intro to HTML/CSS: Making webpages </h2>
  <p class ="para"> Intro to html/css is a course on khan academy all about the basics of making websites in html and css. It teaches you all about headers and paragraphs but more importantly how to style these bread and butter functions to make them look like a real, pretty website. It gives you all the essential skills to build up your own website from scartch.
