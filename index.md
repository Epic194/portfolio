  <h1>Summary</h1>
  <p> This is my final exam project for my ICS4U computer science course. This portfolio is a website I have coded myself and hosted on github. It will display some of my accomplishments throughout the course such as Khan Academy modules I have completed or creative refactroings of "The Coding Train" projects in java sript and processing. I hope you enjoy</p>
  <h2> Intro to HTML/CSS: Making webpages </h2>
  <p text-align= "left" style="width: 45%"> Intro to html/css is a course on khan academy all about the basics of making websites in html and css. It teaches you all about headers and paragraphs but more importantly how to style these bread and butter functions to make them look like a real, pretty website. It gives you all the essential skills to build up your own website from scartch.

  <p text-align= "left" style="width: 45%"> This course helped me develop almost all of my html knowledge to date. It really is a great foundation for such a different language. This entire website is built of the html foundation that khan academy helped me build. This will help me to continue to learn in the future as html is a very valuable and unique language to know especialy when coupled with js (see below). </p>
